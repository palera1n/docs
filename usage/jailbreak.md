# Jailbreak

## Rootful (recommended) <sub>(for now)</sub>
At the moment, palera1n-c does not support using palera1n tethered. Please use the [original Shell script](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n) to do this.
#### First jailbreak
* Run `./palera1n -f -c`
#### If you've already jailbroken before/created the fakefs
* Run `./palera1n -f`

## Rootless
* Just run `./palera1n`

Please keep in mind that that tweak support is very minimal on rootless.
