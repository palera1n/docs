# Flashing palen1x

palen1x is a stripped-down Linux distribution that runs palera1n. It is based on Alpine Linux and contains everything you need to jailbreak and a simplified TUI.

You'll need a USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage. We will also assume you're on Windows, as you can run palera1n natively on macOS and Linux.

1. Plug your USB drive into your computer
2. Download the Ventoy Windows zip from [here](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases)
3. Extract using your favorite zip program, and open Ventoy2Disk.exe
4. Select your USB drive, and click Install
   * Please be careful to only choose the USB drive
   * All data on the USB drive will be erased forever, please backup whatever is needed
5. Once it's done installing, download the latest palen1x from [here](https://cdn.nickchan.lol/palera1n/artifacts/palen1x)
   * The `amd64` iso is for 64-bit CPUs (AMD and Intel) and the `i686` one is for 32-bit CPUs. If you are unsure which one to download, the `amd64` ISO will work in most cases
6. Drop the iso onto the new Ventoy drive in File Explorer

Done installing Ventoy and palen1x, now go to [Booting palen1x](booting-palen1x.md).
