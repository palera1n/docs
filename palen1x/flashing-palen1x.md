# Flashing palen1x

palen1x is a stripped-down Linux distribution that runs palera1n-c. It is based on Alpine Linux and contains everything you need to jailbreak and a simplified TUI.

You will need a USB drive with at least 8 GB of storage. We will also assume you are on Windows, as you can run palera1n natively on macOS and Linux.

1. Plug your USB drive into your computer
2. Download the Ventoy Windows zip from [here](https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases)
3. Extract the downloaded zip using your favorite zip program, and open Ventoy2Disk.exe
4. Select your USB drive, and click Install
   * Please be careful to only choose the USB drive
   * All data on the USB drive will be erased forever, please backup whatever you need. 
5. Once Ventoy is done installing, download the latest palen1x ISO from [here](https://cdn.nickchan.lol/palera1n/artifacts/palen1x)
   * The `amd64` iso is for 64-bit CPUs (AMD and Intel) and the `i686` one is for 32-bit CPUs. If you are unsure which one to download, the `amd64` ISO will work for          most computers. 
6. Copy the iso onto the newly created Ventoy drive

Now that Ventoy and palen1x are installed, [Boot palen1x](booting-palen1x.md).
