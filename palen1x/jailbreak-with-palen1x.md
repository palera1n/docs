# Jailbreak with palen1x

By default, this boot's with -f enabled in rootful, if you need to create fakefs just go to `2 Options` -> `Create Fakefs`

The options menu looks like this, may be subject to change if palera1n-c ever gets a built-in TUI

Please read [Jailbreak](../usage/jailbreak.md) to see what options you need. Create Fakefs is -c, and -f is default.
